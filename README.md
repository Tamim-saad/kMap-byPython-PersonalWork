# Kmap simulation created by Python. 
# Created only for personal interest.
# Mind that some corner cases are not handled. So, it may give incorrect result for some cases. Otherwise, it gives correct results in most of the cases.

# Overview:
This project is a 4-variable Karnaugh map (K-map) solver implemented in Python, designed to simplify Boolean algebra problems efficiently. Developed out of personal interest and for academic enhancement, this solver provides a user-friendly interface and leverages K-map principles for logic simplification.

# Project Details:
Development Time: 3 days
Platform: Python, developed in PyCharm
Background: Completed after Level-2 Term-1 at BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology)

# Key Features:
Boolean Algebra Solver: Simplifies Boolean expressions involving four variables.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy input and output for a seamless user experience.
Efficient Logic Simplification: Utilizes K-map principles to minimize logic expressions quickly and accurately.

# Why K-Map?
Karnaugh maps are essential tools in digital logic design, providing a visual method for simplifying Boolean expressions. They help minimize errors and optimize circuit performance. This solver automates the process, saving time and effort for users.
